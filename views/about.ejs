        Hilma af Klint (26 October 1862 - 21 October 1944) was a Swedish artist and mystic whose paintings are considered among the first abstract works known in Western art history. A considerable body of her work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian.

        She belonged to a group called "The Five", comprising a circle of women inspired by Theosophy, who shared a belief in the importance of trying to contact the so-called "High Masters"â€”often by way of sÃ©ances. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex spiritual ideas.
